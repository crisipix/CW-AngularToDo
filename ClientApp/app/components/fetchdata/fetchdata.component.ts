        Switching from http to HttpClient
        https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45129790/difference-between-http-and-httpclient-in-angular-4v
        It's an upgraded version of http from @angular/http module with the following improvements:

        1. Interceptors allow middleware logic to be inserted into the pipeline
        2. Immutable request/response objects
        3. Progress events for both request upload and response download
            You can read about how it works in Insiderâ€™s guide into interceptors and HttpClient mechanics in Angular.

        4. Typed, synchronous response body access, including support for JSON body types
        5. JSON is an assumed default and no longer needs to be explicitly parsed
        6. Post-request verification & flush based testing framework
